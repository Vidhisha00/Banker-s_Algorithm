# Banker-s_Algorithm
Implementation of Banker's Algorithm in Python

The banker’s algorithm is a resource allocation and deadlock avoidance algorithm that tests for safety by simulating the allocation for the predetermined maximum possible amounts of all resources, then makes an “s-state” check to test for possible activities, before deciding whether allocation should be allowed to continue.

This project is the simple implementation of the algorithm. Here the user has to specify the number of resources and process as an input. After entering all the necessary details, as a result, we get to know whether the system is in a deadlock state or not.
